# VSB Class Tracker
Helps with signing up for classes at McGill.
When given a list of courses you are interested in taking, this program will find the number of seats in each of the classes of that course for the given term.
At the moment, this program only works on future terms and can break down if you select an ongoing term.
vsbClass.py is currently the main file.

# Requirements
This program requires the Selenium Chrome Driver to be installed in the same directory as these files to run properly.
